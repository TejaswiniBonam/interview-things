# What is SQL? (Structured Query Language)
* SQL is a standard language for managing and manipulating relational databases.
* It is used to query, insert, update, and delete data.


### Is SQL only for relational database?
* SQL is fundamentally associated with relational databases, its principles and syntax have influenced a variety of other database technologies, allowing for similar querying capabilities in non-relational contexts.

### Types of SQL commands
* 4 types
  * **DDL - Data definition language** = define and manage all database objects, such as tables, indexes, and schemas.
    * **CREATE** = To create new database objects.
    * **ALTER** = To modify existing database objects.
    * **DROP** = To delete database objects.
    * **TRUNCATE** = To remove all records from a table without deleting the table itself.
  * **DML - Data Manipulation language** = managing and manipulating data within existing database objects.
    * **INSERT** = To add new records to a table.
    * **SELECT** = To retrieve data from one or more tables.
    * **UPDATE** = To modify existing records in a table.
    * **DELETE** = To remove records from a table.
  * **DCL - Data control Language** = control access to data within the database.
  * **TCL - Transaction control language** = manage transactions in a database, ensuring data integrity.
  * **Procedural SQL** = extend SQL with procedural programming capabilities, allowing for the creation of complex scripts and stored procedures.
  * **Embedded SQL** = SQL statements that are embedded within a programming language (like Java, C, or Python) to interact with a database.
